                            <p> I have an Intel Core i7 6700K CPU with integrated Intel HD Graphics 500. I've recently had problems with Win 10 not detecting the integrated graphics, and even-though I have a GTX 1080 Ti, I believe the integrated graphics is what's been causing another current but new problem with Windows saying "Application has been blocked from accessing the graphics hardware" whenever I play a game or watching YT or Netflix. So, I used DDU to clean my my Intel graphics drivers, and now the latter issue seems. 
Hey fellow redditors Because of the university not being near my home I have to sleep in a dorm an have to be satified with my netbook as a gaming device 5 days a week. I really love playing Skyrim, but as you could guess, it doesn't really run that smooth . What mods could really help me boost my fps and what settings should I use for my ini? And would it be possible to use some of enai's mods? (I've gotten quite used to having them) My specs are: 8gb ram intel pentium N3700 Ok so I didn't have this issue the other day, I factory reset my pc and now i'm having this issue. Whenever I alt+tab out of any game that is fullscreen mode and go back into the game window either by clicking it or alt+tabbing back into it, the game has crashed with a white screen (the audio hasn't crashed) I have google a solution for this and searched through literally hundreds of posts and similar instances with no fix (these were dated pre-2015). PLEASE HELP! do not say: "don't ALT+TAB.

I know lightweight gaming laptops for this budget seem a little optimistic, but I am wont be demanding much from it. amp#x200B; A) See, i have never owned a graphics card.NEVER! I do consider myself a gamer but all my gaming is done on my i5-3570k with intel hd 4000. So i believe an mx 150 2gb would be a huge upgrade for me. I mainly want to try some older games and the most gpu intensive one of the lot would be Witcher 3. I have gamed at low settings all my life so it won't really Soo this is my first time buying a gaming PC so I have no clue what I am going to buy but I saw a really good PC on Amazon which is also quite cheap.

Hey. I've updated my intel 630 HD to 26.20.100.6709 (Win 10 may update version) and I get no graphics panel at all. Neither when I right click neither when I search it via windows. amp#x200B; ( Here's how my control panel looks when i search for intel. 
Video files work fine. It worked before update and uninstalling vlc and trying an old version does not fix it. I believe the update messed up a dvd codec (possibly for audio) or something. Media player classic plays the disk fine. I have tested with multiple disks so it is not a disk issue. I have put the entire debug output with the error replicated. To replicate the error I set playback to the middle of disk however it does not only freeze when changing playback time. Pausing </p>
